merge_notes.py - merges two near-duplicate vault notes into one, per #220.

`/obsidian-health` finds duplicate pairs and stops (it is read-only by contract).
This script does the mechanical half of the merge: frontmatter union (canonical
wins on conflict, the loser is recorded under `merged_from:`), folding the
retired note's title into the canonical note's `aliases:`, and replacing the
retired note with a short `type: redirect` stub so wikilinks keep resolving and
the file is never deleted (references/write-rules.md - the vault is a permanent
record).

The merged BODY is deliberately NOT composed here. Deciding what is actually a
contradiction between two notes' prose is judgment, not mechanics - the same
split heal_links.py (mechanical) draws against triage_links.py (AI judgment).
commands/obsidian-merge.md composes the body (following references/ai-first-
rules.md: one `## For future agent` preamble, both provenance trails kept,
contradictions listed) and hands it to this script via --merged-body-file.

Dry-run and --apply run the exact same compute_merge() and differ only in
whether write_exact is called - the preview promise ("shows the diff and the
proposed merged note") is worthless if apply could write something dry-run
never showed.

Look-only, preview everything:
    python scripts/merge_notes.py --path "/vault" --canonical "A.md" --retire "B.md" \
        --merged-body-file /tmp/merged-body.md
List the duplicate pairs vault_health would report, without merging anything:
    python scripts/merge_notes.py --path "/vault" --from-health
Resolve the other side of a pair from the health scan and write it:
    python scripts/merge_notes.py --path "/vault" --from-health --canonical "A.md" \
        --merged-body-file /tmp/merged-body.md --apply
