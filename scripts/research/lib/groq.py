"""Groq-hosted Whisper transcription for the /podcast fallback chain.

Why Groq: free tier (7,200 audio-sec/hour ASH), whisper-large-v3-turbo, and a
single POST accepted per chunk - same provider family the repo already uses
via /x-read (openai-compatible endpoint). Used when an RSS housing feed has no
<podcast:transcript> tag and no OPENAI_API_KEY, or runs before it in the chain.

Design (binding redesign, 2026-08-30): DOWN_SAMPLE_FIRST. One 32kbps mono
re-encode pass puts ~4.5h of audio under Groq's 25MB per-request cap, so the
common case is one request with no seams. Only longer episodes hit the split
path, where bitrate is exactly known (we just wrote the file), so chunk
durations can be computed rather than guessed, and chunks are cut with real
~10s audio overlap so seam dedup has something to work with.

On ANY Groq HTTP failure at any chunk (429 ASH exhaustion, network, upstream)
we bail out entirely (return None) - the caller treats the whole episode as
Groq-unavailable and falls through to the OpenAI Whisper / show-notes chain.
Quota per-chunk retry/backoff is deliberately NOT built: episode-level
granularity keeps the fallback chain simple, avoids mixed-provider transcripts
breaking provenance, and the natural hourly reset makes long-running retries a
non-issue for /podcast's interactive usage pattern.
