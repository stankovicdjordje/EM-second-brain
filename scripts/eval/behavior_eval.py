"""Behavior eval: does having the vault actually make the ANSWER better?

`retrieval_eval.py` measures whether search returns the right note. It says
nothing about what happens next - whether an agent that can see that note
actually gives a better answer than the same agent with no vault at all. This
harness closes that gap on the synthetic corpus from `corpus.py`:

  1. Load behavior cases (`corpus.behavior_cases()`) - fact, decision,
     relationship, cross-note synthesis, and contradiction questions, each
     carrying an `answer_key`: the canonical fact text the question is about.
  2. For each question, generate two answers: one with vault retrieval
     available (`vault_ops.search()` results assembled as context), one from
     the model alone, no context. Both use `research.lib.grok` only.
  3. Grade both answers with a DIFFERENT model - `research.lib.gpt` - blind to
     which answer came from which condition: it sees "Answer A" / "Answer B"
     only, labels randomized per case (seeded, so re-judging the same cases
     is reproducible), graded against the case's `answer_key`. The judge must
     never be the same model that wrote the answers, or a model grading its
     own output risks self-preference bias inflating the vault-on score - a
     startup check refuses to run if the two resolve to the same model.
  4. Report the overall delta (vault-on score minus vault-off score), a
     per-category breakdown, and a complete, never-truncated list of cases
     where the vault-on answer scored WORSE. A zero or negative delta is a
     valid result, not a bug - this harness must show that as cleanly as a
     large positive one.

This is a smaller, noisier instrument than the retrieval eval: LLM judging on
a synthetic corpus of a few dozen cases is not a scientific-grade signal for
"the vault helps." Treat any single run's delta as suggestive, not a claim -
that caveat belongs on every number this script prints, not just in the
README.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/eval/behavior_eval.py --generate 20
    uv run python scripts/eval/behavior_eval.py
    uv run python scripts/eval/behavior_eval.py --cases scripts/eval/behavior_cases.jsonl --json
    uv run python scripts/eval/behavior_eval.py --answer-model grok-4.5 --judge-model gpt-4o-mini

Env (from ~/.config/obsidian-second-brain/.env): OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH required
(point it at a corpus.py --out vault for a reproducible run); XAI_API_KEY
required to generate answers; OPENAI_API_KEY required to judge them. There is
no key-free fallback - unlike retrieval_eval.py's heuristic question
generator, both answering and judging are LLM calls.
