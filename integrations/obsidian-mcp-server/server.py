"""Obsidian Second Brain MCP server.

Exposes the vault as a set of MCP tools so any MCP client - Hermes Agent (via
`discover_mcp_tools()`), Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor - can search, read,
and add notes to an Obsidian vault. This is the "second brain as a tool" connector
(GitHub Issue #60): it does NOT touch the agent's own memory; it gives the agent a
doorway into the knowledge vault.

Run:
    OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=/path/to/vault uv run --no-project --with 'mcp<2' python server.py

or wire it into a client's MCP config (see README.md).
"""

# DO NOT add `from __future__ import annotations` to this module.
#
# Symptom if you do: the server dies during startup and the client lists zero
# vault tools, with "issubclass() arg 1 must be a class" in the logs.
#
# Cause: PEP 563 turns every annotation in this module into a plain string.
# fastmcp inspects each tool's signature at registration time and calls
# `issubclass(param.annotation, Context)` to find the context parameter.
# `issubclass` needs a real class, so a string annotation raises TypeError on
# the FIRST @mcp.tool() it walks, which aborts registration for all of them.
#
# This is a fastmcp limitation, not a defect in this file. Annotations below
# are therefore evaluated eagerly at import time, so every name used in an
# annotation on a decorated function must be importable at module scope
# (no `if TYPE_CHECKING:` guarded names in those positions).
#
# Note that the `mcp<2` pin in .claude-plugin/plugin.json does not prevent
# this. On a current index `mcp<2` resolves to the latest 1.x (1.29.1 as of
# 2026-08, where fastmcp handles string annotations and all 12 tools register
# with the import present), but a resolver that lands on an older 1.x such as
# 1.9.4 hits the issubclass path above. The pin guards against the 2.x rewrite
# dropping `mcp.server.fastmcp` entirely; it does not pin a 1.x that is safe
# here. Leaving the import out keeps the server working on every 1.x. If the
# pin is ever lifted to 2.x, recheck the issubclass path before bringing the
# import back.
