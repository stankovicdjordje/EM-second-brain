"""The vault ingests untrusted text and then rewrites the user's own notes.

Before this, nothing in the project stated that a source is data rather than
instructions. A grep across SKILL.md, commands/, references/, integrations/ and
hooks/ matched prompt-injection language exactly once, in SECURITY.md, listing
it as in scope for reports. Meanwhile obsidian-ingest instructed the agent to
rewrite existing entity, concept, and project pages from claims in the source.

These are documentation and wiring fences, not behavioural ones. A model can
still be talked into ignoring a rule; what these guarantee is that the rule is
present, reaches the commands that need it, and that the one channel which
injects into every prompt cannot serve verbatim third-party text.

The audit's own note: "There is no adversarial fixture anywhere in tests/."
