"""Safety guarantees for the MCP server's read and write paths.

vault_ops backs the connector: search, read, backlinks, save, update, validate.
Everything here runs over a live connection against a user's real notes, which
makes it the one place in the codebase where a torn write or a silent overwrite
costs something irreplaceable.

Each test corresponds to a defect that was actually present:
  - save_note overwrote a same-day note of the same title, returning success
  - the protected-directory guard compared a lowercase set against un-lowercased
    path parts, so `Templates/` sailed through, and `raw/` was never protected
  - both write paths used bare write_text, so an interrupted write truncated
  - reads used plain utf-8, leaving a BOM on the first line of every snippet
  - link and stem comparison skipped NFC, so accented notes looked like orphans
