"""The credential file's mode, and drift between SKILL.md and the command files.

Two gaps the audit named that no test covered.

The .env file holds every research API key. install.sh creates it at 0600 and
setup.sh then rewrites it through a temp file, which under a default umask
replaced that with 0644 - readable by any other account on the machine. The
repo already had the analogous guard for vault notes
(test_note_safety::test_write_exact_preserves_permission_bits); the credential
file, which is the more sensitive of the two, had none.

SKILL.md inlines step lists for roughly fifteen commands that also exist as
files under commands/. When the two disagree, behaviour depends on which text
happened to load, and that has bitten twice: the log.md instructions (B11) and
three different wordings of the same vault_health invocation (B39). This does
not diff prose - that would be noise - it pins the specific facts that drifted.
