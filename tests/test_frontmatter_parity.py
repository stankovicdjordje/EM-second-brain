"""Frontmatter parity, exclude validation, and two silent-failure holes.

  S9  three regexes disagreed on real input. A note whose opening fence carried
      trailing whitespace had frontmatter to vault_health and vault_stats and
      none to export_okf, which then wrote the frontmatter into the exported
      body as prose and typed the note `note`
  B20 `exclude:` was an unvalidated string match, so a plausible misspelling
      shipped a Claude-only command to every platform with exit 0
  B40 note keys used str(Path), which is backslash-separated on Windows, so
      every `rel.split("/")` saw no separator and the top-folder logic returned
      "" for every note - collapsing the skip-folder and dated-series exemptions
  B35 unattended hooks appended to a fixed, predictable, world-readable path in
      the shared /tmp
